# React CV Project

This is my first React project: a personal CV / portfolio page. It was created to polish my knowledge and skills in **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Vite**, and **Cloudflare Pages**.

You can view the live project here: [https://react-cv-project.pages.dev/](https://react-cv-project.pages.dev/)

## Features

- Built with **React** and **Vite** for fast development and build.
- Styled using **Tailwind CSS** for responsive and modern design.
- Deployed on **Cloudflare Pages** for fast global access.
- Fully responsive layout, works on desktop and mobile.
